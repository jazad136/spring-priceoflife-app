data model: 

STAPKLE: 
The good's COMMON_NAME describes (no spaces) (up to 80 characters). It is not necessarily a key.  
The good's FULL_NAME describes a fuller description for the food in question (with spaces) (up to 120 characters) 
The good's SELECTOR describes, when a good is duplicated, which specified item it is. 
The good's FOOD_ID is an integral identifying the food across the tables. 
The good's MANU_CENTER, or central location where it is manufactured and used
 
PRICE: Each entry contains
The good's FOOD_ID, constrained to values from the GOOD table. 
The good's NAME (common_name from GOOD table) 
The good's decimal PRICE (decimal(5,2)) describing some dollar price between 0 and 1000 dollars
The good's CPI index VALUE (decimal (6,3) describing some price between 0  and 1000 units)
